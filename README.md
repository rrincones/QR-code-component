### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

The main thing I learned was how to center elements both horizontally and vertically using Flexbox. I had to look up how to do this once I discovered that I couldn't center an element vertically by using the margin property set to auto. The rest of the challenge allowed me to reinforce things I previously learned through tutorials. Sometimes I pick up tidbits here and there as I search for things on the MDN developer site and other places. 

### Continued development

Because this is my first project, I realize I still have so much to learn that it's hard to pick just a few things to focus on. However, a few things that stand out are CSS Flexbox and Grid and getting better at using the correct semantic HTML elements. I want to nail down the fundamentals and just establish good habits as I continue to learn.
