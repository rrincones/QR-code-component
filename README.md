### What I learned

The main thing I learned was how to center elements both horizontally and vertically using Flexbox. I had to look up how to do this once I discovered that I couldn't center an element vertically by using the margin property set to auto. The rest of the challenge allowed me to reinforce things I previously learned through tutorials. Sometimes I pick up tidbits here and there as I search for things on the MDN developer site and other places. 

### Continued development

Because this is my first project, I realize I still have so much to learn that it's hard to pick just a few things to focus on. For example, I had to spend a few hours just learning about how to use GitHub for this project. There are other things that have popped up on my radar that I want to learn about such as Markdown and UNICODE. Whenever something comes up that I don't know much about, it goes on my list of things to learn, even if it could be deemed nonessential to my current undertakings. So, while I can't pick just a few things, I can say that I really want to make sure I nail down the fundamentals and build good habits as I progress.
